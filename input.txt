I’m Jakub Polec — a physicist by training, systems architect by practice, and founder of QuantJourney, an AI-first infrastructure platform powering strategy research and execution for hedge funds, family offices, and proprietary trading firms.
With a career spanning over 20 years, I’ve built institutional-grade quant frameworks, machine learning research engines, and multi-cloud infrastructure used by some of the most forward-looking investors and governments. I’ve also founded five companies, raised venture capital, led successful exits, and delivered award-winning innovation across the US, EMEA, and GCC regions.
 
Quant Finance & AI Infrastructure
•	QuantJourney was built to accelerate strategy discovery — from idea to backtest — using a flexible architecture for cross-sectional, multi-asset, and factor-based strategies.
•	Supports deep AI-driven factor modeling, regime detection, and portfolio signal generation across thousands of assets — including equities, futures, crypto, and FX.
•	Our proprietary Strategy Development Language (SDL) enables quants to define, validate, and optimize alphas using technical, fundamental, and macro signals — without rewriting pipelines for each new idea.
•	Trusted by a few hundred clients globally, including hedge funds, family offices, and advanced quants managing $10M–$500M AUM.
“What others spend years building in fragmented stacks — we deliver in weeks, at scale, with elegance.
Clients often respond with just one word: 'Wow.'”

Quant Development & Systems Engineering
I don’t just write code. I build infrastructure that rivals top quant firms.
•	Architected QuantJourney with a multi-cloud, horizontally scalable architecture.
•	Every client runs in a fully isolated environment — ensuring data security, compliance, and reproducibility — modeled after best practices at Tower Research and Two Sigma.
•	Supports 100+ parallel backtests across 5,000+ assets, with async execution, smart scheduling, and full observability.
•	Native support for multi-cloud deployments (Hetzner, AWS, GCP, Azure) and hybrid setups (on-prem + cloud) — enabling quant teams to scale flexibly.
•	Designed to empower lean quant teams to operate at Citadel-scale — without Citadel-size engineering teams.
⚡ When CTOs and fund managers see it, they often say:
“Wow. This is world-class.”
 
Entrepreneurial & Corporate Leadership
•	Founded 5 technology companies, with VC funding and successful exits — including one of the earliest AI startups in Central Europe, awarded Best Startup in CEE (2005).
•	Delivered enterprise-grade solutions and digital architecture for:
o	Microsoft (MEA Innovation Lead)
o	Oracle EMEA
o	France Telecom / Orange, T-Mobile, and telcos across Europe
o	Dubai Government, Ministry of ICT (Qatar), and major state-backed organizations in Saudi Arabia
•	Recipient of the Microsoft CEO Award for Best Marketing Campaign
•	Led cross-functional global teams in high-stakes, fast-moving environments — always at the frontier of technology and innovation.
 
Physics, Science & Deep Technology
•	Background in theoretical and applied physics, with early research work at CERN — where I developed the analytical mindset and systems discipline I now apply in finance and technology.
•	I bring scientific precision to every layer of development — from model validation to infrastructure resilience — building systems that are explainable, testable, and robust under real-world volatility.
